# bib-kram

We want to interact with overdrive library data (or something to organize books)

combine different sources of personal book lists, public genres/tags

group books into lists

link back to library overdrive/libby

David's suggestion: reading lists, seems similar to playlists
collecting, list making as an aesthetic practice
